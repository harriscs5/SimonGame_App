# Simon Game App
 I have recreated the classic Simon Game with JavaScript. The object of the game is to repeat a series of random tile clicks created by the game. After each round, the sequence becomes progressively longer and more complex which makes it harder to remember.
 
 Typically, youâ€™ll have four different tiles, each with a unique colour and sound which is activated when pressed. The sound aids the player in remembering the sequence and the game ends if the player misses a step in the sequence.
